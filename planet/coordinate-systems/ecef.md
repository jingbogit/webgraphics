# ECEF

This is a simple Cartesian coordinate. Its origin is at the earth center.

Astonishingly, different softwares may use different up direction \(which goes through the north pole\). We adopt the one defined on wiki. 

The Z axis goes through north pole. 

the X axis goes through \(longitude:0, latitude:0\)
