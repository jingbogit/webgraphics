# Engine Interface

Friendly to web developers. 开发人员无需3D视觉和图形学知识，接口设计遵从广大前端工程师开发习惯

The Engine is an interactive 3D graphics library in JavaScript. It is specialised in efficient streaming, rendering, and interacting with giant Level of Detail 3D data. It has a well-designed RAM/GPU/CPU resource management scheme to guarantee both quality and performance. The Engine is designed to be portable as it runs on most operating systems and browsers. 

The SDK is a 3D library for front-end developers. It uses HTML-like interfaces to encapsulate complex computer graphics concepts. Developers can easily create a 3D earth \(a Sandbox\) like creating a canvas, adding various 3D contents \(Markers\) like adding div-elements, registering gesture/mouse events with individual 3D element. The Sandbox and Markers have abundant properties and styles, which are interfaces to computer graphics algorithms. 

* 3D elements  -&gt; HTML elements
* rendering effects -&gt; CSS style
* Interactions -&gt; Events

3D elements:

* LOD Mesh
* LOD Point cloud
* BillBoard
* PolyLine, Polygon, Extrude volume
* Particles
* etc.
